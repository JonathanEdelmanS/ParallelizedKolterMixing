Essential Information:
--------------------------------------------------
1) The input file (or graph) has the form:
         n   m          (i.e.,  |V|, |E|)
         i   j   wij    (for all ij in E)

2) The 1st line in the file param.file specifies 
   the actual parameter file to be used.

3) The file param.default contains the default
   parameter values.

4) To get better solutions, increase the values
   of the parameters: nperb and multi.
